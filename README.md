# Image Detection CNN with ResNet

This project uses a pretrained ResNet model to classify images into three categories:

- **0** – Explicit (fully nude)  
- **1** – Half-naked / Suggestive  
- **2** – Safe  

## Folder Structure

- `data/` – Dataset folder  
- `src/` – Source code  
- `checkpoints/` – Saved models  
- `run.py` – Script to train and evaluate the model  

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:  
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
